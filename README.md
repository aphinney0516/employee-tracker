### Description
The goal of this project was to produce a CLI application that could store emplpyee information in an SQL data base, view it, and update it providing emplpyers with one place to convieniently do it all. The most challenging aspect of this project was figuring out how to add to, update or delaete information from databases. I unfortunately ran out of time to complete these aspects of the code.
